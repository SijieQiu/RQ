***Beauty Premium***

 ``` The "beauty premium" is an old and complex topic that explores the impact of appearance on social recognition and individual interactions. ```In 2006, [Why beauty matters](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282806776157515) decompose the beauty premium in an experimental labor market where "employers" determine the wages of "workers" who perform a maze-solving task. This task requires real skills, so we first identify such skills as unaffected by physical attractiveness. Instead, the experiment reveals that the beauty premium is quite large and is to some extent related to the worker's own self-confidence. 
  
  In 2015, both [Now you see it, now you don't: The vanishing beauty premium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268115001420) and [Myth or fact? The beauty premium across the wage distribution in Germany](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517651500052) reveal us that the beauty premium is highly context-dependent: there is no beauty premium in data entry or data analysis, for example. Instead, the most attractive employees are penalized by beauty, as well as in Germany, where the beauty effect varies across the wage distribution (especially in the tails). This premium is mainly present at the bottom of the female wage distribution, but takes the form of a premium for highly educated women and a penalty for less educated women. The characteristic gap suggests that attractive women have better access to other characteristics of the labor market that largely explain the wage differential between beautiful and average women at the bottom of the wage distribution. For men, the beauty premium is present across the distribution, but it is driven by the highly educated. We find no characteristic gap for men. And despite the fact that beauty is valued in the workplace, employers seem to favor the educated, especially women. One possible explanation lies in the types of jobs (mainly white-collar jobs) that highly educated people hold, especially low-paying jobs. These occupations may value beauty differently than occupations with a higher wage distribution or those with lower levels of education. The types of jobs held by both highly and less educated women may also contribute to the stereotype that "beautiful women are less intelligent." Both types of discrimination are entirely statistical and can be explained by bias against the performance of relatively attractive employees. 
  
  In 2020, [Is the beauty premium accessible to all? An experimental analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016748702030009X)Demonstrates that by using cosmetics, women can more easily access the beauty premium, which is not just an immutable attribute. When people use cosmetics for visual manipulation, not only do attractiveness perceptions increase, but so do other attributes (e.g., perceived trustworthiness), implying that women receive greater transfers in a trusting environment. The experiments also found that this effect was not direct, but fully mediated by trustworthiness. This effect is particularly pronounced among less attractive women. Thus, to some extent, people can strategically manipulate perceived trustworthiness through the use of visual resources such as cosmetics, photo filters (e.g., Instagram filters), and so on. These resources may not only provide intra-personal benefits, such as increased self-confidence, but it may also increase the effectiveness of interpersonal interactions that require cooperation, coordination, and trust. Finally, visual manipulation of appearance may not only affect women. If men choose to alter their facial appearance by growing a beard or wearing makeup, it may have the same effect on trust.This opens up new avenues for research.
  
# 2.Research Question

***a.To what extent does attractiveness influence entrepreneurial opportunities or customer behavior? On male or female seperately?***

 ***b.Does the beauty premium or beauty penalty work equally well on second-hand online trading platforms?***
 

``` To explore the RQ, I'd consider employing a mixed-method approach. Here are a few steps to address the RQ: ```

***Quantitative Analysis:***

Data Collection: Gather data from second-hand trading platforms that include product listings and sellers' profiles.

Variables: Identify key variables like seller ratings, price, product descriptions, and images.

Quantitative Measures: Quantify attractiveness using image analysis tools or crowd-sourced ratings.

Statistical Analysis: Use regression models to analyze correlations between attractiveness, product prices, and seller ratings.

Control Variables: Consider factors like product condition, brand, and seller credibility.

***Qualitative Analysis:***

Seller Interviews/Surveys: Understand seller experiences related to attractiveness and perceived advantages/disadvantages.

Buyer Feedback Analysis: Analyze comments or reviews related to seller attractiveness and its impact on purchase decisions.

Content Analysis: Examine product descriptions to see if attractiveness is emphasized and its potential impact on sales.

***Integration and Conclusions:***

Compare Findings: Evaluate if there's a correlation between seller attractiveness and pricing/sales, comparing qualitative and quantitative data.

Identify Patterns: Determine if a beauty premium or penalty exists on these platforms.

Limitations and Recommendations: Discuss limitations of the study and offer recommendations for further research.

```This mixed-method approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of the beauty premium concept on second-hand online trading platforms, considering both quantitative and qualitative perspectives to address the research question effectively.```
